			<h3>Global Abortion Data Brings New Findings</h3>
				<section class="byline">Kate Jackson JNL211 Final Project</section>
			<p><br>The aftermath of the Roe v. Wade decision drastically changed the framework of medicated abortions, not only in the United States, but on a global scale. Access to safe and affordable abortion has become a topic of heated debate since the June 2022 overturning. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Through global statistics and data modeling, researchers at the Guttmacher Institute have successfully estimated global abortion levels across different regions and countries. <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/jonathan-bearak" target="_blank"> Jonathan Bearak</a>, Senior Research Scientist, explained that the Institute uses a model to interpret the raw data because, outside of official statistics, many abortions go unreported in various countries. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“The majority of the people on this planet do not live in a country where you have reliable official statistics,” Bearak said. “Because abortion is highly stigmatized, you can't rely on people's reports and surveys.”
			<br>
			<br>
			To successfully predict the real level of abortions, Guttmacher uses post-abortion clinical care data, United Nations family planning estimates, level of contraceptive usage, access to affordable abortion, fertility statistics, and other reliable data to create a highly accurate model, Bearak said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about" target="_blank"> The Guttmacher Institute</a> is a “research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) worldwide.” Established in 1968, it has been a globally recognized organization for five decades and remains dedicated to the founding cause— equitable access to birth control.
			<br>
			<br>
			Alan F. Guttmacher, an obstetrician-gynecologist and former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation, was the main founder of the center. While initially housed within the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), the organization separated in 2010 and became an independent nonprofit policy research institute with its own 19-member board of directors in 2010. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The institute has a total current staff of 115 demographers, social scientists, public policy analysts, editors, writers, communications specialists, and financial and technical personnel. Part of what distinguishes the Guttmacher Insitute is its ability to work across different specialties, combining on-the-ground research with policymaker initiatives.
			<br>
			<br>
			To successfully influence United States policy, a large part of the Institute's job is to translate the science into something officeholders can easily digest and understand, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/kelly-baden" target="_blank">Kelly Baden</a>, the Vice President for Public Policy said. “Most policymakers are not reading long research papers, they don't have the time,” she said. “So our job as advocates is to make it as seamless as possible for people to understand what our science and data are calling for.”
			<br>
			<br>
			As the VP for public policy, Baden oversees the US federal public policy team, state policy teams, and the global team. She said their goal is to “ensure that the advocacy and policy change that we seek to make happen is grounded in evidence.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			This way policymakers can clearly see what's happening, access global impacts and take action. “A New York Times front page story is often more powerful than, you know, 15 individual emails to a legislator's office,” Baden said.
			<br>
			<br>
			Complied by <a href="https://osf.io/5k7fp/" target="_blank"> The Guttmacher Institute</a>, The Global Abortion Incidence Dataset details all abortion data from 1990 to 2018 gathered from official statistics, studies, and surveys with information about sources, miscarriages, and whether or not the data is considered complete with a reason listed if not. About 97% of the global abortion data collected comes from official statistics.
			<br>
			<br>
			“Official statistics means that it was reported from the government,” Bearak said. “So for example, the Ministry of Health and the National Statistics Office.” The UNSD was used 1196 times as a source in this dataset, while Guttmacher Questionnaires were sourced 610 times.
			<br>
			<br>
			“In high resource settings, where legal abortion is broadly available, you tend to have reliable official statistics, but not always,” Bearak said. This is where statistical modeling comes in. In places where abortions go highly unreported, researchers recognize this and input it into the model, with varying levels of bias. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The model is designed to produce a distribution of possible values that are consistent with all the data put into it. The medians of these distributions are used as point estimates, with a 50% chance the real value is lower and a 50% chance the real value is higher, Bearak said.
			<br>
			<br>
			Taking a deeper look, it's clear some country's abortion numbers tower over others. An overwhelming majority of abortions, almost 90%, came from East and Southeast Asia, Europe and Northern America between 1990 to 2018. 
			<br>
			<br>
			More specifically, Eastern Asia was responsible for 40% of abortions during this time frame, the most of any sub-region. Eastern Europe follows this with 26% and North America with 12%.      
			<br>
			<br>
			While population plays a large role in the total number of abortions by region, contraceptive use is another leading factor. In many countries, contraception use became more widely accepted over time, creating an inverse effect on unintended pregnancies and abortions. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Generally speaking, if you're talking about Western Europe, those are countries where women are the most successful at avoiding unintended pregnancy when they so desire,” Bearak said. While other regions, like Asia, have different motivators. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The data also shows a 57% percent increase in abortions globally from 2014 to 2015. Abortions decreased again by 2017 by 53% and continued to decline until 2018. While these trends seem dramatic, there is no major global phenomenon at play. It is more likely that different countries are experiencing different trends in the same timeframe.  
			<br>
			<br>
			“It's not like abortion rates were declining in a certain place and then started increasing in that same place,” Bearak said. “They were declining in certain parts of the world, and then, they were increasing in other parts of the world at other points in time.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			One example of this was in 1990 when there was a massive decline in abortion incidence due to a switch to contraceptive use in the Eastern Bloc, Bearak said. Whereas other places, specifically Asia, had different societal and political trends during that period. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Legality and accessibility are also responsible for many disparities in abortion rates across countries.  
			<br>
			<br>
			“Legality varies throughout the world,” Baden said. “But you know, what's interesting is that data also show that abortion happens regardless of legality.” Abortions have always been needed and will always be needed, which is clear through Guttmachers data, Baden said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			For instance, conservative countries are often believed to have fewer abortions but this is not always the case. “You actually have higher abortion rates in those extremely conservative settings because there are so many more unintended pregnancies,” Bearak said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Stigma also plays a huge role. Even if abortion is accessible, there may be societal or familial repercussions. When analyzing abortion from a policy standpoint, social and cultural context play a “huge role,” Baden said. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Policy and decision-makers are “people too” and are influenced by cultural standards just like everyone else. “We make policies and laws that really often reflect and are reflected by changes in social norms,”  Baden said. “And there's often a push-pull between culture driving policy change and policy change driving culture.” 
			<br>
			<br>
			Guttmacher’s job as an “advocacy organization” is to make the data available, and as understandable as possible, so that policymakers can pick up their end of the bargain. 
			<br>
			<br>
			“Sexual and reproductive health and rights are core to every person's health care, and also core, of course, to their just freedom, bodily autonomy, dignity, to make their own decisions, and live their own lives,” Baden said. “So the science that we conduct or that anybody conducts really is what is necessary, but not sufficient for policy change.”
